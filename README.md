# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect Div Content Replacement

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to replacing the content of a div element in HTML.  The incorrect approach uses `innerHTML` with a number, while the correct approach uses `textContent`. While the number replacement might seem to work visually, it's semantically incorrect and can lead to problems with certain browser functionalities or JavaScript interactions.

## Bug Description
The primary issue involves directly assigning a numeric value to `innerHTML`, which is designed for handling HTML content. This can cause unexpected behavior and is less robust than using `textContent` to add or change the textual content.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe the unexpected behavior - potentially a mismatch between what's shown and what the innerHTML actually holds.
4. Open `bugSolution.html` and see the correct usage. 

## Solution
Use `textContent` to replace the div's text content instead of `innerHTML` when working only with text.  This is a cleaner and more semantic approach.

## Note
This demonstrates a subtle error that might not be immediately apparent, but is crucial for writing robust and reliable HTML code.
